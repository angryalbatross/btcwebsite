description: I helped Pine Cove improve the efficiency and usage of their Salesforce org in several ways. I worked with them to find a new online donations system that recorded recurring payments inside Salesforce and linked them to accounts.  I also created a new invoicing and event management system for their retreats team.  Furthermore I integrated a live chat system with their website and Salesforce org.
